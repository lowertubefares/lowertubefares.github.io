        <div class="maintext">
            <bold>We propose a new discount card that would act as a stepping stone towards a just fares system, helping welfare recipients to achieve financial security. This would help alleviate costs to the taxpayer long term</bold>
            <br/>
            <p>Of course the most pertinent solution to high tube fares would be to increase national spending on the TfL. The TfL is more self reliant than any other major European city’s transport system, and is expected to be run in a financial surplus like a private company. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding about the role of public transport on the part of the British government, that stems from the TfL’s unique history. However given the economic downturn the UK is in, it seems unlikely any government would undertake the political burden of transitioning the TfL into a normal transport organisation. 
            </p>
            <p>Right now it is more pertinent to focus on the changes that Sadiq Khan’s government can make to minimise the damage caused by the TFL's pricing. Changes like the recent Friday freeze can go a long way not only to dampening the effects of the cost of living crisis on individuals, but also in terms of revitalising the post Covid economy. </p>
            <p>In a similar light we propose another policy. <a href="https://www.londontravelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Living-on-the-edge_full-report_final.pdf">Studies have shown</a> that the group most impacted by the price of the Tube is those who live in the outer boroughs of London, yet commute to the centre for work. This is thanks to the ultra high cost of moving between zones. We propose a new discounted travelcard for people who live in the outer boroughs and are on welfare, that would apply a small discount for journeys crossing multiple zones. Many people who live in the outer boroughs of London are faced with the difficult choice of whether they should settle for lower pay locally, or commute into central London but lose a significant amount of their paycheck to their commute. Having a travelcard like this could help alleviate this burden for those most in need, and dampen the effects of the cost of living crisis. </p>
            <p>However it's also important to consider the economic benefits. For many people on welfare finding long term employment amidst the UK’s floundering economy poses a significant challenge. Studies conducted on both a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60080f728fa8f50d8f210fbe/Transport_and_inequality_report_document.pdf">national level</a> and within <a href="https://www.londontravelwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Living-on-the-edge_full-report_final.pdf">Greater London</a> both found that the cost of commuting to a job was a key element in prospective employees decision making. Making the commute into central London more accessible wouldn't just create employment opportunities, but also higher paying jobs. The same studies also found that people working in zone one generally have higher incomes. Hence a discount card would not only alleviate the financial burden of transport for those already working in the centre, but also create new, higher paying opportunities to help universal credit recipients in the outer boroughs get off welfare and become economically active. 
            </p>
            <p>A policy like this would cost ONLY about as much each year as Sadiq Khan’s THREE MONTH Friday freeze. </p>
