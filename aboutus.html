            <b>We collect donations to help subsidise transport costs for Londoners struggling to make ends meet</b>
            <br/>
            <p>We work to combat the effects of high transport fares on lower-income Londoners, with a particular focus on individuals impacted by the high cost of travelling across multiple zones of the London Underground.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Londoners who travel into central London from zones 4-6, which are the furthest from central London, are subject to the highest transport fares out of any of London’s daily commuters. Many people choose to work in central London because of better pay and a greater variety of employment opportunities. However, due to London’s unusually high transport fares (most significantly on the London Underground itself) a significant portion of these commuters’ paychecks has to go to transport fees, chipping away at the amount they bring home.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>High tube fares have become even more of a problem for individuals who live in zones 4-6 because of the exorbitantly steep increase in cost incurred by taking the Tube in between zones. This leads to a difficult situation for many individuals and families which are struggling financially, where they have to choose between losing a significant amount of pay to transport fares and choosing local work with worse pay and benefits.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Donations to Lower Tube Fares help subsidise transport costs for Londoners who are impacted by the financial burden of commuting. The charity GIFT helps us distribute Oyster cards to those in need, which we fund and top up weekly using donations raised from student groups and individuals who contribute to our cause. You can help us make a difference for those most in need by pressing the "Donate Now" button on the to right of the screen.  </p>
