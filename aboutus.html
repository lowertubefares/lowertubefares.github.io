            <p><i>Lower Tube Fares</i> is a non-profit charitable group that works to combat the effects of high transport fares on lower-income Londoners, with a particular focus on individuals impacted by the high cost of travelling across multiple zones.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Londoners who travel into central London from zones 4-6 are often subject to the highest transport fares out of any daily commuters. Many people choose to work in central London because of better pay, however due to Londonâ€™s unusually high transport fares (most significantly on the London Underground) oftentimes a significant portion of paychecks has to go to transport fees, chipping away at the amount they bring home.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>High tube fares become even more of a problem for individuals who live in zones 4-6 because of the exorbitantly steep increase in cost the more commuters move between zones. This leads to a difficult situation for many struggling individuals and families, where they have to choose between losing a significant amount of pay to fares and dealing with a long commute, or choosing local work with poorer pay.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Donations to Lower Tube Fares help subsidise transport costs for struggling Londoners. <!--The charity JGIFT-->A charity helps distribute Oyster cards we provide to Londoners who are burdened by the cost of commuting, and when the cards run out they are returned to us and we use donations to top them up. All donations are used for subsidising the cost of transport, not for funding policy proposals or activist activities.</p>
