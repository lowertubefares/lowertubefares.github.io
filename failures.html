            <b>Studies show that the cost of Tube fares makes it difficult for people in underdeveloped communities to find higher paying jobs that require commuting via the Tube</b>
            <br/>
            <p>London has by far the most expensive transport costs in the world, even compared to other major European cities, like Paris or Berlin. The cost of the tube is huge, and has a large impact on Londoners. Having such an expensive transport network makes life unnecessarily difficult for those struggling, a problem increasingly magnified by the cost of living crisis.</p>
            <p>Studies have shown that Londoners spend almost twice as much per km travelled by tube than the global average. However the disparity is also evident when comparing fare prices independently. In other major European cities like Paris a monthly travelcard card costs about £73 (converted from Euros), and a single fare about £1.80. In London both travelcards and single fares are more than double the price. This dysfunctionality highlights the drag put on Londoners and their finances by TfL, something that isn’t present in other transport systems across the globe.</p>
            <p>However the high tube fares are more than just unethical. Having such an expensive cost of travel eats away at us Londoners’ disposable income, reducing consumer spending on more essential expenses. One study questioned Londoners on the extent to which they change their weekly expenditure as a result of transport fares. In this study respondents were asked to what extent they agreed with each statement on a scale of one to five. The results, shown below, illustrate how consumer behaviour is shaped by fares. </p>

            <p>This issue is especially prevalent in the context of post covid recovery, as the government struggles to revitalise the hospitality sector and consumer spending broadly. Sadiq Khan’s recent move to make all fares off peak on Fridays was meant to explicitly address this issue by encouraging more people to have nights out at the end of the week. </p>
