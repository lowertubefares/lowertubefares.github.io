            <p>Almost all Londoners are impacted in one way or another by the immense cost of transport. While we believe that the status quo of the TFL is unjust and inherently fosters inequality (see Problems & Policies), it is also important to remember that the TFL has many existing discounts. A study by London TravelWatch revealed that many people struggling with the cost of transport are not aware of them and thus subject to an unnecessary financial burden. </p>
            <p>Some criteria for eligibility include being a student, claiming certain benefits, and looking for work. A detailed description of each discount can be found on the<a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/free-and-discounted-travel/jobcentre-plus-travel-discount" >xTFL’s website</a>. We aim to do our part in spreading awareness about these discounts, and so these discounts are summarised below - however if you are unclear or want a more detailed explanation make sure to check the website itself to minimise your transport costs. If you have been out of work for more than 13 weeks and are claiming certain benefits, then you will likely be able to claim the <i>Jobcentre Plus Travel Discount</i>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are a veteran you are likely eligible for the <a><i>Veterans Oyster photocard</i></a></li>
                <li>If you are a care leaver between the age of 18 and 25 you are likely eligible for the <a><i>18-25 Care Leaver Oyster photocard</i></a></li>
                <li>If you are studying for more than 15 hours each week you are likely eligible for an <a><i>18+ Student Oyster photocard</i></a>. Unfortunately this largely excludes people taking evening classes, however if you are studying in any capacity it is still a good idea to check your eligibility on the TFL website</li>
                <li>If you are taking an apprenticeship for a minimum of 12 months, you may be eligible for an <a><i>Apprentice Oyster photocard</i></a></li>
                <li>If you hold any kind of travelcard, then you are eligible for an <a><i>Annual Gold Card Discount</i></a>, which allows discounted travel during off peak times</li>
                <li>If you are claiming Universal Credit or other benefits then you may also be eligible for discounted bus and tram travel, through a <a><i>Bus & Tram Discount photocard</i></a> </li>
                <li>And of course, discounted travel for youth (<a><i>Zip cards</i></a>) and for the elderly (<a><i>60+ London Oyster photocard</i></a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unfortunately many of the discounts provided by TFL do not apply to London Underground, where prices are the most extreme, only bus and tram services. However if you are struggling with transport costs it may also be a good idea to look into the possibility of an <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/how-to-pay-and-where-to-buy-tickets-and-oyster/travelcards-and-group-tickets">annual travelcard</a>. Depending on what zones you plan to commute through <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/new-fares">they cost between £1700 and £3100</a> per year (Once clicking the link, scroll down to see the travelcard section). If you have secure employment for the foreseeable future but are still struggling with the cost of transport, then it might be worth calculating your yearly expenditure to see whether an annual discount could provide net savings. </p>
