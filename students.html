            <p><i>Lower Tube Fares</i> is primarily organised through schools and student groups around London. Running a student group can include a variety of activities: educating your school community on the problems we seek to combat, encouraging other students to take an active role in creating change in our community, and organising fundraisers to contribute towards our charitable purposes. </p>
            <p>Generally we encourage each school group to have one primary student ambassador, who we can stay in contact with to coordinate future activities. A big part of being an ambassador is making our message approachable in an engaging way, and being creative is a key part of communicating dynamically. For example at one school students even organised a “rap battle” as a fundraiser, which was quite a hit. It's important to us that students stay energetic and remember that striving for a better society is something to be passionate and excited about, even if the problems we’re facing aren't so uplifting. </p>
            <p>If you're interested in creating a student group at your school or university then send us an email at <a class="mail" href="mailto:lowertubefares@gmail.com">lowertubefares@gmail.com</a></p>
